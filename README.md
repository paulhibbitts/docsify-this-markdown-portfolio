<h1 align="center">Markdown Portfolio</h1>

This repository serves as a template to easily construct, customize, and publicize a personal portfolio using Markdown. Though it is always fun and impressive to design and deploy a gorgeous personal website, one need not do so in order to show off their portfolio. Simplicity is often just as effective as complexity, if not more so. Hence, this template utilizes Markdown for clean portfolio design, with the intent of being located in a GitHub repository for ease of access.

Below resides the template for the main page of your portfolio. Linked within the main page are various other named pages that serve as their own respective templates. These templates may provide examples on what to include. For example, you may provide a headshot of yourself on the main page.

Everyone is encouraged to fork, copy, or reference this repository and customize it to their own liking. You need not adhere to everything provided in this template. You may add, modify, or remove anything as you see fit. Your portfolio is yours to own and customize. Get creative and share your portfolio with the world!
